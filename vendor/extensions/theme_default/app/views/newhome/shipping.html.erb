  FREE SHIPPING on all orders over $75!!!
  <br />
  <br />
  All online orders are shipped twice weekly. Everything is shipped USPS from, you guessed it, New Jersey. All packages are shipped Priority Mail (3 business days) and envelopes (stickers and other such things) are sent standard postage (3-5 business days).
  <br />
  <br />
  Generally, it shouldn't take more than week to ten days to receive your order, but if there are any delays we'll let you know as quickly as possible via email.
  <br />
  <br />
  If you need an item by a specific date, don't leave it in the hands of the Post Office - either call us or stop in the shop to pick up what you're looking for.
